<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Eat croissants in Paris, learn to cook Greek food, see the Northern Lights, ride a mechanical bull or bungee jump? Most of us have goals and aspirations, things we have always dreamed of doing or hope we could experience in our lifetimes.

It is a personal journey between you and your aspirations. Each one should be different because it is meant to reflect what you most desire in your own life. For example, mine includes learning to surf, skydiving, and rappelling down a waterfall to appease my adventurous side. If you are not a thrill seeker, your list may be entirely different.

This React application is designed to help you to achieve your goals and live life at the fullest!
